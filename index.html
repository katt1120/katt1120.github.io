         <p>I am a Dual Credit student at Bob Jones University.I am going into interior design when I come to be a fulltime student in the fall. When I'm not doing homework, I like to listen to podcasts and play pc games.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy participating in community outreach events, and I am active in my local church: Cornerstone Baptist Church in Greenville S.C. I babysit the kids whos parents are in the choir and orgestra while they are praticing, and I help on our cleaning crew. I love going on youth group trips and this June we will be going whitewater rafting.

            I also enjoy boardgames and baking.
